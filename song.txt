I really wanna change the world, but can't change my clothes
Wanna find a girl, but can't find my phone
I just lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreamin' 'bout the things that I wanna do

If I wanna change the world, I should change myself
I should make my bed, I should dust the shelf
Shouldn't lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreamin' 'bout the things that I wanna do, mmm

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

'Bout the things that I wanna do
At first, my calculations
Seem bulletproof to me
There can be no humiliation
Without accountability
